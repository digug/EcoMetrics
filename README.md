## ESG Investing

In our project, we will be using the Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) metrics to evaluate companies that's listed on the stock market.

Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) refers to a set of criteria that investors and organizations use to evaluate a company's performance and impact in areas beyond traditional financial metrics. These criteria are designed to assess a company's commitment to environmental sustainability, social responsibility, and governance practices. The goal is to consider a broader set of factors that may affect the long-term sustainability, and hence profitability of a business.

Here's a brief breakdown of each component of ESG:

Environmental (E): This aspect focuses on a company's impact on the natural environment. Key considerations include the company's efforts to reduce its carbon footprint, manage waste, conserve energy, and implement environmentally friendly practices. Companies with strong environmental performance often demonstrate a commitment to addressing climate change and minimizing their ecological impact.

Social (S): The social component assesses a company's relationships with its employees, communities, and other stakeholders. Factors include labor practices, diversity and inclusion, community engagement, human rights, and product safety. Socially responsible companies prioritize fair labor practices, diversity, and community development.

Governance (G): Governance evaluates the structure and practices of a company's leadership, management, and oversight. It includes considerations such as board composition, executive compensation, shareholder rights, transparency, and ethical decision-making. Strong governance practices contribute to the accountability and ethical behavior of a company.
