              A Yahoo Finance portfolio typically includes a list of assets you
              own, accompanied by relevant financial metrics and performance
              indicators. Ensure that your portfolio file contains detailed
              information about each holding, such as stock ticker symbols,
              quantities, purchase prices, and current market values. The more
              comprehensive the data, the more accurate and insightful our
              evaluation can be.
